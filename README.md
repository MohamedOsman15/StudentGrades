*Description*

Teacher hub is a simple app that allows teachers to login and view the grades and class lists of the students at their school.  It uses Prostres, ReactJS, HTML & CSS to provide a clean user experience and simple to operate interface.  With TeacherHub, a teacher can login and access various information such as a complete list of students at their school including their overall GPA and individual student records displaying that student's class list as well as a grade for each class. Additionally, teachers can add new students to the school roster as well as add new courses.
